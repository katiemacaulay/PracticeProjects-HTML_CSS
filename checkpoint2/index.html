            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <div class="musicclass">
              <p>
                Thank you for coming to my site to learn more about music education at St. Theresa’s Catholic School. We believe that making music is an integral part of serving, student development, and expressing our faith. PreK-6th Grades have music as class integrated into their school year, and Middle School has two new performance based electives: Musical Theater performing The Wizard of Oz in the Spring and Rhythm Cats, our percussion ensemble.
              </p>
              <p>
                Students at St. Theresa’s not only learn the fundamentals of reading, writing, and performing music, but learn music as a creative and expressive art.  Whether students are 5 years old or 13 years old, all students are learning music with the goal of experiencing a wide variety of ways to express ourselves and how to make our own music through composition and improvisation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Making music is taught in a fun and interactive way, so everytime we have class there is something to look forward to learning.

        <h3>Musical Theatre</h3>
        <p>
          We will focus on
          vocal technique, collaboration, and performance.  Students will have several opportunities to perform; including the Diocesan Choral
          Festival, Grandparents’ Day, and potentially at a Basketball Game. During Fall Semester students will
          audition for the Spring Musical. In the Spring semester, students will focus on staging, acting and preparing for the Musical.

          <h3>PreK-2nd Grade</h3>
          <p>
            Early development of music involves learning to match pitch, basic rhythms, non-pitched percussion playing technique and being able to keep a steady pulse. We focus on music as a tool of expression and use movement a lot to describe musical ideas.
